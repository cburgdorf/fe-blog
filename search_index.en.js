been roughly a month since we officially announced Fe as a new EVM compatible language. Since then, we've made vast progress and want to give the community a chance to catch up with the recent development.\nThere have been a total of 23 merged Pull Requests by 4 different people and we would like to take the chance to highlight some of the development.\nSay hello to our official logo\n\nAs all Fe development happens entirely in the open, we were fortunate to have designer Daniel Iñiguez show up to offer his help and create this logo for Fe. It is \"Fe\" written in iron blocks.\nConstructors\nFe can now handle constructors with a syntax similar to that of Python. Here is an example:\ncontract Foo:\n    bar: map&lt;u256, u256&gt;\n\n    pub def __init__(baz: u256, bing: u256):\n        self.bar[42] = baz + bing\n\nImplicit return of ()\nFe now treats functions that do not explicitly return anything the same way that Rust does by implicitly returning () (an empty Tuple). To let code speak; all of these mean the same thing:\nFull length form\ndef foo() -&gt; ():\n    y: u256 = 1\n    return ()\n\nNo explicit return in signature\ndef foo():\n    y: u256 = 1\n    return ()\n\nNo explicit return statement\ndef foo() -&gt; ():\n    y: u256 = 1\n\nNo return in signature and function body\ndef foo():\n    y: u256 = 1\n\nNote that empty tuple literals are not supported yet, so some of the examples will not compile.\nSemantically, this is how Rust treats empty function returns. The reason why we followed suit is because it makes code more straight forward and saves us from having to implement a special type for empty function returns. Functions simply always return something even if this something means it's the () type.\nString and dynamically-sized ABI type support\nSupport for encoding of dynamically-sized arrays was prioritized this month so that we could implement strings, which are used in the ERC-20 contract. Although strings are encoded dynamically, their sizes are capped by the developer. In practice, these sizes look similar to the sizes of numeric types (e.g. u8, u16, .., u256). With strings, though, the size is representative of bytes and is not limited to a set of predefined sizes, meaning the developer can specify any size (e.g. string32 or string5555).\nHere's a piece of working Fe code that shows strings in action:\ncontract Foo:\n    event MyEvent:\n        text: string100\n        amount: u256\n\n    pub def bar(text: string100, amount: u256):\n        emit MyEvent(text, amount)\n\nMiscellaneous features\nThere's a whole bunch of features that weren't yet supported four weeks ago. Without going into too much detail, let's just list them here:\n\nFunction calls (with or without arguments)\nIf / Else statements\nWhile Loops (including break and continue statements)\nBoolean support\nAssert statements\nEvents with multiple parameters\nMany improvements to our ABI encoder\n\nFinal words\nThere's been a lot more development that didn't get mentioned here, but we'd like to keep these updates short and crisp. Maybe just a short teaser, fe.ethereum.org has been set up and currently refers to the generated API docs, but will be replaced by a proper website soon.\n","id":"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/development-update-1/","title":"Fe Development Update #1"},"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/development-update-2/":{"body":"It's been a month since our last development update and we'd like to take some time once again to fill you in on our progress.\nIn this time, we've merged a total of 20 Pull Requests from 3 different people, finished implementing all the features required for an ERC-20 contract, expanded type support, and have begun planning our first release.\nERC-20 support\nEarlier in October, we set the year-end goal of completing support for all of the features used in a basic ERC-20 contract. We're proud to say that we hit our target about a month earlier than planned. The compiled bytecode is fully tested using rust-evm and appears to work just fine. Keep in mind, though, that the compiler is still experimental, so we do not recommend deploying any tokens to mainnet quite yet.\nMisc new features\n\nSupport for all sizes of signed and unsigned integer types.\nIndexed event parameters.\nAll types may be used as contract fields now. Previously, we only supported maps.\nThe CLI can now emit pretty-printed Yul and JSON ABIs.\nSupport for ternary statements (thanks @satyamakgec).\n\nRelease plan\nWe're looking forward to getting the compiler into people's hands and receiving feedback. Starting mid-January, we'll be cutting binary releases on our Github page every month. With these binaries, you will be able to generate contract ABIs, bytecode, and Yul IR. If you would like Fe and its tooling to accommodate you, please consider downloading a compatible binary and create issues for anything that seems out of place.\nWhat's next\nNow that we've finished support for an ERC-20 contract, we will be turning our focus to a working implementation of the Uniswap V2 protocol. We plan on having this done by April of next year. By focusing on such a widely used platform, we are able to identify desirable features.\nSpecial thanks\nOur project currently has ~80 contract fixtures that are deployed and tested using rust-evm. Being able to reliably test all of these contracts within a fraction of a second has been invaluable to the development process. We'd like to thank @sorpass and other contributors very much for the work they have done on this EVM implementation.\n","id":"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/development-update-2/","title":"Fe Development Update #2"},"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/development-update-3/":{"body":"Howdy, this is our first development update in 2021. We would once again like to keep you up to date about all the progress that happened since the previous update.\nWe shipped v0.1.0-alpha \"Amethyst\"\nEarlier this year, we landed our first alpha release with binaries for Linux and Mac. If you are as excited about Fe as we are, you might want to grab a binary from here and play with some examples.\nWhat's especially exciting about this release is that it has kicked of a fixed release cycle that we have committed to. From now on, we'll be shipping one release per month.\nJust keep in mind that these are all alpha releases and are not supposed to be used for real world development just yet. Fe still has a long way to go before it can be used in production, but the pace of development is promising.\nMore user-defined types\nWe now support two new type definitions -- structs and contracts. \nStructs\nStructs are a group of named variables in one segment of memory. They help with writing organized and efficient code.\nFor now, Fe only supports structs consisting of base types, this will be changed to include all types in a later version.\nExample usage of a struct:\nstruct House:\n    price: u256\n    size: u256\n    vacant: bool\n\ncontract Foo:\n    pub def bar() -&gt; u256:\n        building: House = House(300, 500, true)\n        assert building.size == 500\n        assert building.price == 300\n        assert building.vacant\n\n        building.vacant = false\n        building.price = 1\n        building.size = 2\n\n        assert building.vacant == false\n        assert building.price == 1\n        assert building.size == 2\n        return building.size\n\n\nUsage of structs in Fe is pretty run-of-the-mill, so we won't go into too much detail describing the code above.\nFurther down the road, we intend to support function definitions on structs.\nContracts\nFe of course already allows you to define contracts, but it wasn't until recently that contracts became types in their own right.\nNow, if a contract definition is in the module scope, it can be used to conveniently deploy, load, and interact with contracts. Below is an example of a contract being loaded and called:\ncontract Foo:\n    event MyEvent:\n        my_num: u256\n        my_addrs: address[5]\n        my_string: string11\n\n    pub def emit_event(\n        my_num: u256, \n        my_addrs: address[5], \n        my_string: string11\n    ):\n        emit MyEvent(my_num, my_addrs, my_string)\n\ncontract FooProxy:\n    pub def call_emit_event(\n        foo_address: address,\n        my_num: u256,\n        my_addrs: address[5],\n        my_string: string11\n    ):\n        foo: Foo = Foo(foo_address)\n        foo.emit_event(my_num, my_addrs, my_string)\n\nHere an address is being cast to an instance of Foo and called using the attributes of foo.\nWe can also create new contracts, like so:\ncontract Foo:\n    pub def get_my_num() -&gt; u256:\n        return 42\n\ncontract FooFactory:\n    pub def create_foo() -&gt; address:\n        # value and salt\n        foo: Foo = Foo.create(0)\n        return address(foo)\n\nIntroducing to_mem() and clone()\nThese two builtin functions have been added for convenience when dealing with reference types. Here we'll explain why they were added and how to use them.\nTo understand what clone() does, consider the following example:\npub def example(my_array: u256[10]):\n    # assign my_array to another reference\n    second_reference: u256[10] = my_array\n\n    # Both variables point to the same section in memory\n    assert my_array[3] == 5\n    assert second_reference[3] == 5\n\n    # Changing the 3rd item in second_reference also affects my_array\n    second_reference[3] = 50\n \n    assert my_array[3] == 50\n    assert second_reference[3] == 50\n\nAs you can see, assigning a reference type to another variable does not copy the underlying data, it only creates a second variable that points to the same place in memory. This may not be what we want, though. We may want two distinct copies of the underlying data. In these situations, we can use clone() to copy the value to a new segment of memory. This is demonstrated in the following example:\npub def example2(my_array: u256[10]):\n    # clone my_array into second_array\n    second_array: u256[10] = my_array.clone()\n\n    # Both variables hold identical data to begin with\n    assert my_array[3] == 5\n    assert second_array[3] == 5\n\n    # But changing the 3rd item in second_array does NOT affect my_array\n    second_array[3] = 50\n \n    assert my_array[3] == 5\n    assert second_array[3] == 50\n\nNow that we understand clone(), let's talk about to_mem() for a minute. In the first example, we said that second_reference: u256[10] = my_array creates a second reference to the same point in memory without copying the underlying data. This only works for reference types in memory, not storage. Consider this other example which won't compile.\npub def example4():\n    # THIS DOES NOT COMPILE\n    second_array: u256[10] = self.my_array\n\nThe reason this code 👆 doesn't compile is because Fe won't let variables hold mutable storage pointers. This is on purpose. State mutation should be explicit in Fe, so we limit the places where state mutation takes place to statements that begin with self (e.g. self.my_array[1] = 1 or self.mutate_me()). If we were to have mutable storage pointers running around in variables, someone could mutate state in a statement like my_array[42] = 26, which can make the contract's behaviour difficult to understand.\nNote: For now, all storage pointers are considered mutable, so the assignment rule described above currently applies to all storage pointers. In future versions of Fe, we will likely add Rust-style variable mutability, making it possible to assign storage pointers (as long as they're immutable).\nThere are of course instances, though, where one would like to assign data found in storage. Since the only assignable pointer location is memory, we must copy values from storage and into memory before assigning them. To accomplish this, we provide the builtin function to_mem(). The to_mem() function is similar to clone(), but is used to copy values that are in storage to memory.\nIn the example below, we demonstrate how to_mem() can be used to pass an array held in storage into a function:\npub def example3():\n    self.my_function(self.my_array.to_mem())\n\nFor more information about how we plan on dealing with pointer locations in Fe, checkout RFC #161.\n\nWhew! This was a lot to unpack. Here are a few more contributions we'd like to mention:\n\nSupport for compiling modules with multiple contracts (See PR#197)\nSupport for many builtin attributes (e.g. block.timestamp, See PR#208)\nCLI output can be overwritten via --overwrite (See PR#206)\nSupport for static strings (e.g val = \"foo\") (See PR#182)\nLots of fixes and type safety improvements\nA number of bugs have been identified by Alex Groce using afl-compiler-fuzzer\n\nIf you like to learn more about these, reading the linked Pull Requests should be a good start.\nWhat's next\nWe continue to work against our current target: Having a working Uniswap demo written in Fe. Building examples of real world Ethereum applications helps us to prioritize important features. If you are interested in tracking our progress you might want to checkout our Uniswap demo milestone on Github.\nSpecial thanks\nWe would like to thank our new contributors Sean Billig, Volodymyr Lykhonis, Satyam Agrawal and Alex Groce who all did amazing work with their issues and pull requests that helped us move Fe forward.\n","id":"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/development-update-3/","title":"Fe Development Update #3"},"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/development-update-4/":{"body":"Hello, it's time for another Fe development update. There's alot to share since the last one.\nWe shipped v0.2.0-alpha \"Borax\"\nThis release contains many of the improvements mentioned in our last development update. You can find more details on the release page. \nUniswap Demo\nIn December of last year, we set a goal to support the features needed for a basic implementation of the Uniswap-V2 core contracts before April. The features were catalogued in this Github Milestone and tagged with priority levels. We were able to close all high-priority issues and added a test that demonstrates the behaviour of our implementation. In short, we are able to do the following:\n\nDeploy the Uniswap factory contract.\nCreate a new pair using the factory contract.\nAdd liquidity to the pair.\nPerform a swap.\nWithdraw liquidity.\n\nThere are still a few rough edges, though. These are documented in the Uniswap module using TODO comments that link to issues. The remaining issues will be worked on over the next few months, but are not of high priority.\nSafe arithmetic\nOne of Fe's core promises is to perform safe arithmetic operations by default. This is something that you'll find in our next release. Now if the result of an arithmetic operation, such as x + y, exceeds or falls below the upper or lower limit of the type, the transaction reverts. Developers have so far relied on the SafeMath library to perform these kind of safety checks. It's worth pointing out that Fe also checks power operations (i.e. base ** exponent), which the SafeMath library does not check. Fe's integrated arithmetic checks use the same Yul code as Solidity 0.8.0 (Thanks Solidity!).\nIn the future, we will likely add support for a special wrapping type similar to Rust that allows develops to explicitly opt-out from these checks. This is something that may be used to save gas, if you know what you're doing.\nRelated PRs: #265, #267, #271, #312, #313\nMore work on structs\nLast month we shipped basic support for structs. Since then, we've landed some new improvements to our struct support.\n\nAccept structs as parameters to public functions or return them from public functions (#296)\nUpdate individual struct fields in storage (#246)\nRequire keyword syntax to initialize structs (#260)\n\nOther features and bugfixes\n\nPrevent numeric literals from exceeding 256 bits (#247)\nSupport boolean not operator (#264)\nSupport boolean and operator (#270)\nSupport boolean or operator (#270)\nSupportself.address (#270)\nExpose abi_encode function (266)\nSupportmsg.sig (#311)\nFix several cases where conflicting names were not properly handled (#317)\n\nContinued compilation fuzzing\nagroce has continued fuzzing the Fe compiler. Since our last development update, he has found 12 instances where the compiler crashes for some input. These bugs often point to missing checks in the fe-analyzer library. Investigating them is very insightful. Thanks Alex! You can checkout the fuzzer here.\nWhat's next\nHere are a few things we'll be working on over the next few months:\n\nMore checking: Compilation fuzzing has shown us that we need to be checking source code more thoroughly. We'll focus on adding complete checking.\nLowering pass: This makes the compiler more composable and transparent. It will first be used to support tuples.\nDifferential contract fuzzing: We'll be making sure our demo contracts  work exactly like their Solidity counterparts.\nImproved errors: We'll make error messages more clear and useful.\n\nYou can also expect more demos, but they'll be smaller topics of discussion.\n\nStay tuned for more monthly updates and releases.\n","id":"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/development-update-4/","title":"Fe Development Update #4"},"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/development-update-5/":{"body":"We've been hard at work since our last update and can't wait to talk about all the latest progress we've made. Let's dive right in.\nTeam growth\nNot only did we receive a steady flow of external contributions, we've also grown the core Fe team by two new (part-time) software engineers. Say hello to Sean and Satyam who will be helping us on our way to change the EVM language space. Fe is happy to have you 🙏\nPart of their efforts have already formed the latest release that just shipped.\nWe shipped v0.4.0-alpha \"Diamond\"\nWe've actually shipped two releases since the last update but many of the changes from the 0.3.0-alpha release were already covered in our last development update. As usual, the entire list of changes can be found in the changelog on the release page. In this article, we'll focus on the two most exciting recent developments. \nA brand new parser\nNot only does the 0.4.0-alpha release come with a shiny name, it comes with a new, shiny parser, too.\nOur old parser was by far the oldest part of the code base and it had served us well up to this point. Shout out to David who wrote it when he originally started the project under a different name.\nAs we are moving closer to our first non alpha release we've made it a high priority for Fe to have high quality, context-aware error messages. While this may not have been impossible with the old parser, the new handwritten recursive descent parser gives us all the flexibility and clarity that we need to enable great rust style error messages.\nTo give an example, consider this wrongly formatted source code:\ncontract Example:\nval:u8\n\nWhile we can and will tune the quality of our error messages, the following example of an actual Fe error message does already demonstrate the improved user experience that we got out of the parser rewrite so far.\n\nWe currently continue to streamline our error reporting across the different processing stages to take advantage of the improvements on all levels.\nWhile the parser rewrite was mostly motivated by improving our error messages it will also help us to implement new features faster.\nLowering pass\nThe other major improvement that just landed in the latest release is an entirely new compile phase called the \"lowering pass\". Lowering is compiler speak for what is commonly referred to as \"desugaring\".\nIn other words, whenever we say that something is just \"syntactic sugar\" for a longer, less-elegant syntax, it is the lowering pass's job to take that code and turn it into the less-elegant, but simpler syntax. This is a technique that many modern compilers use, including rustc.\nBy using lowering, we are able to simplify the implementation of new features and reduce compiler complexity.\nTuples\nTo give a concrete example, our latest release comes with support for tuples, which can be used like this:\ncontract Foo:\n    pub def bar(my_num: u256, my_bool: bool) -&gt; (u256, bool):\n        return (my_num, my_bool)\n\nFe's new lowering pass rewrites this as follows:\nstruct tuple_u256_bool:\n    item0: u256\n    item1: bool\n\ncontract Foo:\n    pub def bar(my_num: u256, my_bool: bool) -&gt; tuple_u256_bool:\n        return tuple_u256_bool(item0=my_num, item1=my_bool)\n\nAs you can see, Tuples don't actually exist past the lowering stage, as Tuples in Fe are just syntactic sugar over structs (which by the way, is also true for Rust).\nWe also use the lowering pass for augmented assignments (e.g. x += 1) and plan to use it for many of the upcoming features. It's a real game changer, as it helps us to avoid code duplication and reduces the overall maintenance cost for the features we develop.\nOther features and bugfixes\n\nSupport for revert messages in assert statements (#288)\nSupport for augmented assignments (#338)\nReject invalid emit (#211)\nProperly tokenize numeric literals when they start with 0 (#331)\nReject non-string assert reasons as type error (#335)\nReject code that creates a circular dependency when using create or create2 (#362)\n\nWhat's next\nOur plan is to ship our first non-alpha release in 2021 and hence our focus is currently on implementing the essential features that are still missing as well as eleminating bugs and improving the robustness of the compiler which includes building out tooling for differential contract fuzzing.\nWe will soon write a dedicated blog post that will shed more light on our plans for Fe's road to production.\n\nStay tuned for more monthly updates and releases.\n","id":"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/development-update-5/","title":"Fe Development Update #5"},"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/development-update-6/":{"body":"It's been a month since our last update. In this time, we've merged a total of 22 pull requests from 4 different contributors. Here are some highlights.\nWe shipped v0.5.0-alpha \"Evenkite\"\nThis release contains much of the work we'll cover in this update. You can head over to the release page for more info and downloads.\nGeneric arguments (partially implemented)\nWe've added generic arguments syntax to type descriptions and expressions. This cleans up some existing sore spots in our syntax and prepares us for full-on generic support.\nPreviously, map type arguments (e.g. map&lt;u256, address&gt;) were handled as a special case in the parser. We were also using an ugly syntax for strings (e.g. string42), where the numeric suffix indicated the maximum size of the string. We've now updated the parser to handle generic arguments on all types, so maps are no longer a special case and the max size of strings are expressed using the same syntax as maps (e.g. String&lt;42&gt;). In the case of strings, the generic argument is a const value rather than a type.\nFor now, these are just syntax changes and the underlying type implementations remain the same. In the future, though, we'll be adding support for generic arguments in type definitions. This will enable us to pull the definitions of strings, maps, and other types out of the compiler and into libraries. This will improve the composability of Fe and establish patterns that other developers can use to implement their own types.\nRelevant PRs:\n\nRemove ast::TypeDesc::Map in favor of TypeDesc::Generic #384\nAllow generic arguments in Expr::Call #425\n\nMore expressions\nY-Nak added support for a few more numeric representations.

To solve this problem and to improve the overall design of the analyzer, we now use Salsa, and thus a query-based style.\nSalsa is used extensively in rust-analyzer, which is where we got the idea to use it.\nAdded in #468.\nOther features and bugfixes\n\nTypo fix in docs (thanks @jacobkaufmann!) #549\nFuzzer crash fixed #546\nReadme improvements (thanks @zora89!) #544\nPretty printed display of AST #540\nAnalyzer checks for shadowing of built-ins and generic arg lists where they don't belong #539\nDon't ignore non-fatal parser errors when analysis succeeds #535\nFix \"analysis failed but no diagnostics were emitted\" panics #534\nAdd support for numeric invert operator #526\nCheck labels in function calls on self and external contracts #518\nCover all remaining statements and expressions in the spec #514\nFuzzer crash fixed (thanks @andy-ow!) #510\nlet var decl (thanks @WilfredTA!) #509\nValidate string literals to only allow a subset of ASCII chars #506\nReject certain code that should return but doesn't  #502\nOverhaul spec content #489\n\nWhat's next\nWe are still focused on cutting a beta release before the end of the year and will keep the community updated.

We believe the Solidity team is doing a great job and are clearly doing a lot of things right to maintain their current market share. However, we also believe that more choices for developers will be a net positive for the ecosystem.\nIntroducing Fe\nWe are excited to announce a new smart contract language for the Ethereum ecosystem named Fe (pronounced \"fee\"). The language was originally born as a rewrite of the Vyper compiler (in Rust) to address issues that were highlighted in the Vyper Security Review by Consensys from another angle.\nWhile the initial goal was to have an alternative Vyper compiler, eventually the languages started to diverge in their syntax and it was decided to make a clean cut with a new name. Fe was born.\n\"Fe\" are the letters for the chemical element iron of the periodic table. Iron conveys a sense of durability, and this reinforces the notion of compiler correctness. Rust forms on iron, which ties the name back to the Rust language that the Fe compiler is written in.\nGoals\nThis project inherits a number of things from Vyper; namely it has a Pythonic syntax and emphasizes language safety. As such, the syntax of Fe is largely inspired by Python. This allows for readable and expressive code that would be familiar to developers who have used Python. Fe also uses static typing and limits dynamic behavior to reduce footguns and improve safety.\nAt this early stage in development the differences between Fe and Vyper are still limited. For now, one will notice that Fe borrows a few syntactic properties from Rust. It's likely that Fe will begin to more closely resemble Rust as we continue to add new features.\nCorrectness of Fe's Implementation\nBeyond the language itself, we are taking steps to ensure that the compiler implementation is correct. In other words, there should be a high degree of confidence that executable code produced by the Fe compiler will behave correctly with respect to the language specification.\nSome of the steps we're taking to ensure correctness are listed below:\nWriting a language specification\nA compiler can not be demonstrated to be correct if there is no specification to check against. For this reason, we have begun writing a specification for the language, which borrows heavily from the Rust reference 🦀❤️. This specification will be written as we implement features. By the time we are ready for an audit, we will be able to produce a comprehensive specification.\nImplementing in Rust\nRust is a systems language with strong safety guarantees. These safety guarantees prevent Rust programs from entering undefined behavior. For example, null pointers are not possible in safe Rust. This makes it so that Rust compiler catches bugs during compile time that would otherwise be encountered during runtime.\nUsing distinct components\nFe aims to separate components of the compiler into distinct libraries that follow standard compiler design guidelines. That is, we have implemented parsing, semantic-analysis, and compilation as separate libraries with their own APIs and tests. This separation of concerns makes it easier to understand the behavior of the compiler.\nTargeting Yul\nThe compiler targets Yul as an intermediate representation. Yul is a project being developed by the Solidity team and is intended to be a common denominator between multiple low level platforms, meaning that we do not need to write separate backends for EVM 1.0, EVM 1.5, and eWASM. Currently, the Solidity compiler provides experimental support for Yul -&gt; EVM 1.0 compilation. For the time being, we are just using the Solidity backend for Yul compilation. This has saved us a significant amount of time.\nStandardizing on YUL as an intermediate language may also prove as an convenient gateway to target Optimistic Rollup environments as recently highlighted by Vitaliks Ethereum Roadmap post.\nProgress\nThe EBNF grammar expected by the parser can be found here. The parser provides support for everything specified in that grammar file and includes comprehensive testing.\nEarlier this year, development started on the compiler pass. We were able to add support for a few simple contracts. Most notably, we were able to compile a simple guestbook contract to functional bytecode.\nIn the past month, development on Fe has ramped up significantly. We are optimistic about adding support for all features used in an ERC20 contract and be able to compile one before the end of 2020. To be clear, the compiler will in no way be a suitable choice for a production ERC20 by that time, but we look forward to demonstrating the capabilities of Fe with such a well understood working example.\nFor the curious, here's a simple contract that is already fully functional today:\ntype BookMsg = bytes[100]\n\ncontract GuestBook:\n    pub guest_book: map&lt;address, BookMsg&gt;\n\n    event Signed:\n        idx book_msg: BookMsg\n\n    pub def sign(book_msg: BookMsg):\n        self.guest_book[msg.sender] = book_msg\n\n        emit Signed(book_msg=book_msg)\n\n    pub def get_msg(addr: address) -&gt; BookMsg:\n        return self.guest_book[addr]\n\nGet in touch\nWe are committed to developing a language that will enrich the Ethereum developer community.

Today we would like to reflect on where Fe currently stands, its path to production, and a possible timeline for it.\n\nFe is still in early stages of development and all of our releases are marked as alpha. This means that the software being provided is only partially complete. For instance, the current release is v0.8.0-alpha \"Haxonite\" and comes with a warning that strongly discourages use beyond just tinkering with the language.\nHaving said that, we feel confident that we can move past this alpha stage and into a beta stage before the end of 2021. In the following section, we will discuss this beta release in further detail and provide a rough idea of where we will go from there.\nDefining our beta release goals\nDevelopment of a programming language is a marathon, as there exist many features to implement and tools to build. Fully realizing our current goals will take a long time, so we would rather not let this hinder the release of a usable compiler. For this reason, we are making an effort to cut a release in the near term that can be used in production safely and practically. We call this our beta release. In this section, we will define what should be expected from this beta release.\nBeta non-goals\nBefore we dive into any specific beta goals, let us give some explicit NON-GOALS. Without further ado, here are the things one should NOT expect from our first beta release.\nFeature stability\nLanguages should strive for a release policy which ensures that code written in the language doesn't need to be re-written every time the compiler is updated. Having said that, Fe is far from guaranteeing such a thing, so the first beta release will not be considered stable. This means that developers should expect breaking changes between beta releases. These changes should appear less-frequently over time, though.\nWe follow semver, so stability will be indicated by our first non-zero major version (i.e. 1.0.0). From this version on, breaking changes may only be included in major updates.\nFeature completeness\nBased on what's written above, one can probably gather that feature completeness is also not a beta goal. We want to emphasize that some important features will be missing, which may hinder development. Be warned!\nHere are some of the features that we are excited about, but won't make it into the first beta release:\n\nSupport for generics over types and constant values\nRust style error handling via Result&lt;V, E&gt;\nTraits for structs and interfaces for contracts\n\nThese features may be included in our first stable release, though.\nOptimal gas efficiency\nIn these early stages of development, we have focused more on delivering features rather than minimizing the amount of gas consumed during runtime. We do get some efficiency gains for free from the Yul optimizer, but there are still some simple optimizations that could be performed in the Yul generation phase that are currently not performed. \nActual beta goals\nNow that we've explained what you shouldn't expect from our first beta release, let's turn to the actual goals.\nCompiler correctness\nSmart contracts created using Fe should behave as expected; in other words, the compiler needs to be implemented correctly. If it is not, development teams will have a hard time justifying the use of Fe in their projects. Here we'll discuss the methods used to validate the correctness of the Fe compiler and how we'll demonstrate to the community that these methods have been effective.\nFirst, let's discuss important aspects of the compiler that need to be correct.\nSource code validation: The compiler should reject any invalid source code.\nCode generation: Code generated by the compiler should have the same meaning as the source code.\nRuntime checks: Values are checked during runtime (e.g. arithmetic overflow, ABI decoding, and array index out of bounds). This is done to prevent undefined runtime behavior.\nTo make reasoning about the compiler and testing it easier, we've separated compilation into multiple phases. These phases are: static analysis, lowering, Yul generation, and bytecode generation.\nBelow, we'll discuss the various methods used to validate the behavior of each phase and the whole compiler.\nSnapshot Testing: insta.rs is used to assess the output of each phase and to guarantee regressions don't go unnoticed.\nIntegration testing: Fe source files are written every time a feature is added and are tested using rust-evm. We also run tests against more complicated contracts, like our UniswapV2 demo.\nRuntime function testing: Yul functions added to the runtime are tested directly on rust-evm.\nCompilation fuzzing: A continuously running service tries to find crashes in the compiler by invoking it with randomly generated Fe source code. This finds nuanced errors in both source validation and code generation. You can find the fuzzer here.\nUnit testing: Simple components are validated with unit tests.\nHaving compilation separated into multiple phases and testing each phase is great, but it alone does not gain trust from the community. In order to do so, the compiler will need to be put to the test. This will of course come naturally with time and use on mainnet, but the initial attempts to find flaws will need to be incentivized. Here are two ways we could incentivize people to find flaws:\n\nHave a security firm audit the codebase.\nHost community bug contests.\n\nCurrently, the plan is to start offering bug bounties before the end of the year. These bounties will be open on certain alpha releases and the objective will be to find severe bugs. If this program does not find any serious vulnerabilities within a given timeframe, we will confidently remove the alpha suffix from new releases and use beta in its stead. \nWhen we arrive at a stable release (1.0.0), we might get the codebase audited. This, however, is probably 1-2 years out.\nIt's also worth mentioning that the Yul IR generated during compilation may be exported and audited on its own. This means that one can verify the behavior of their contract without relying on the Fe compiler.\nDeveloper UX\nWe are currently working with contributors from the Fe community to make sure Fe is supported by popular tools that are used within the Ethereum smart contract developer community.\nWe already have some work in progress candidates for some tooling that we believe will become quite important going forward. Shout out to Marek who's been on fire lately to get these off the ground. 🔥 \n\nfejs - JavaScript bindings for the Fe compiler\nvscode-fe Fe language support for Visual Studio Code\nhardhat-fe Fe support for Ethereum's popular development environment hardhat\n\nWhile all of them are in very early development stages we encourage you to take a look or get involved. We are happy to provide some funding on a per task/project basis for substantial contributions.\nDocumentation &amp; Spec\nWe have been working to fill the gaps in our documentation and language specification. Improvement of these resources will continue, with the goal of fully-specifying the language and making the compiler very accessible. \n\nWhile there is still some uncertainty around the exact timing, we feel reasonably confident in saying that we will deliver a beta release in Q4 of 2021 that meets the expectations laid out in this post.\nWe are excited to see what the community will start building on and around Fe when that happens.\n","id":"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/path-to-production/","title":"Fe's path to production"}},"docInfo":{"https://blog.fe-lang.org/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/development-update-1/":{"body":324,"title":4},"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/development-update-2/":{"body":218,"title":4},"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/development-update-3/":{"body":700,"title":4},"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/development-update-4/":{"body":376,"title":4},"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/development-update-5/":{"body":445,"title":4},"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/development-update-6/":{"body":336,"title":4},"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/development-update-7/":{"body":248,"title":4},"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/development-update-8/":{"body":259,"title":4},"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/fe-a-new-language-for-the-ethereum-ecosystem/":{"body":493,"title":5},"https://blog.fe-lang.org/posts/path-to-production/":{"body":713,"title":3}},"length":12},"lang":"English"};
